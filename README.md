# CS8503-GoatSimulator

Created using NCL framework with pre-made graphical code. I created a 3D third-person action game where you take control of a goat and collide with objects. The areas which I worked on include the physics system, collision detection, artifical intelligence, pathfinding and the gameplay mechanics. The rudimentary physics system includes linear/angular motion, collision detection/resolution and spatial acceleration structures.
